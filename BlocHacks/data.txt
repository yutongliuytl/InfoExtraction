My name is Ivana Chylkova. | love singing to classical russian music and dancing to it. | was born in Russia and | speak russian. Since. a very young age, | wanted to travel around the world. | first took a plane.
when | was 2 years old. I find myself to be lucky to be born on december 17 1991 as | really enjoyed that period in time, especially for my childhood. My parents thought me a lot about Russia, and about the
world outside. | always felt compelled to go around living on a salary of 70000$. However, in recent years, my weight dropped to 40 kg due to my stressful job. On another hand, | feel like | am a few
centimeters taller than as | am 5 feet 7 tall now. The success of my research on the newest chair design deserved me some temporary acclaim which | shall treasure.
